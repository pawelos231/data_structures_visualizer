<h1 align='center'>✨ Data Structure Visualiser ✨</h1>
<p align='center'>
Provides coherent, interactive visualisations of popular data structures.<br>
<i><b>[🚧 Work in progress! 🚧]</b></i>
</p>

## Motivation 🙌
We built this program in order to gain a deeper understanding of various data structures. Bundled with animations, in-depth explanations and interactive content, this app is constructed to serve as a lowbrow piece of learning material.

## Progress 🚀⭐
Everything is being put together slowly, mainly due to time constraints. Here's a handy table outlining what remains to be done:

| Structure | Status |
|-----------|--------|
|<p>Linked list</p>|<p align="center">❌</p>|
|<p>Stack</p>|<p align="center">❌</p>|
|<p>Queue</p>|<p align="center">❌</p>|
|<p>Hash table</p>|<p align="center">❌</p>|
|<p>Disjoint set</p>|<p align="center">❌</p>|
|<p>BST</p>|<p align="center">❌</p>|
|<p>AVL</p>|<p align="center">❌</p>|
|<p>BIT</p>|<p align="center">❌</p>|
|<p>PAT</p>|<p align="center">❌</p>|
|<p>Trie</p>|<p align="center">❌</p>|
|<p>k-d tree</p>|<p align="center">❌</p>|

## Technology 🛠️
Everything is built with modern C++. We wanted to go low-level, and decided to stray deep into the unsafe abyss of deceipt hereticism for learning purposes. Don't worry Ferris, we still accept your superiority 🦀✨.

Currently, this project only relies on the standard library and [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib), which is being used for rendering.
